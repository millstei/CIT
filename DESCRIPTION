Description: A likelihood-based hypothesis testing approach is implemented for
  assessing causal mediation. Described in Millstein, Chen, and Breton (2016),
  <DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btw135>, it could be used to test for mediation
  of a known causal association between a DNA variant, the 'instrumental variable',
  and a clinical outcome or phenotype by gene expression or DNA methylation, the
  potential mediator. Another example would be testing mediation of the effect
  of a drug on a clinical outcome by the molecular target. The hypothesis test
  generates a p-value or permutation-based FDR value with confidence intervals
  to quantify uncertainty in the causal inference. The outcome can be represented
  by either a continuous or binary variable, the potential mediator is continuous,
  and the instrumental variable can be continuous or binary and is not limited to
  a single variable but may be a design matrix representing multiple variables.
